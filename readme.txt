The webpage is a simple game of sudoku. The rules are shown below the board. I’ve tried to keep the resources minimal to enable faster webpage. The layout is a html table with a start button to begin the game. A stopwatch is included if the user wants to take a break. And a reset button to start over. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery 1.11.1, LESS CSS.
I’ve used google fonts.

Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE 10, Iphone 5, samsung S3, Galaxy S. The webpage is responsive to devices. 

If I had more time I would have tried to implement a sudoku generator, and also a more accurate stopwatch using the CPU’s clock.
